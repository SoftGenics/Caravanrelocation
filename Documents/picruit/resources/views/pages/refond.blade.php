    Cancellation & Refund Policy
    
    Last updated on Sep 27th 2023
            
        Pioneer academy believes in helping its customers
        as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under
        this policy:
    
    
        
            
                Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately
                after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be
                entertained if the services have been delivered/communicated to the student/client
                or in case of project work, work has been started.         
        
        
            
                In case of receipt of poor, incorrect or inadequate services from tutor
                or candidate please report the same to our Customer Service team within 2 days.
                The request will, however, be entertained once picruit has verified it and 
                determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within
                2 days of receipt of the products.
            
        
        
            
                In case you feel that the service received is not as shown on the site
                or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our
                customer service within
                2 days of receiving the services. The Customer Service Team after looking
                into your complaint
                will take an appropriate decision.
            
        
        
            
                In case of complaints regarding services offered directly by candidate/ tutor where picruit is not involved in any                     		financial transaction or not involved as a party, no refund claim will be accepted by Pioneer, please refer the issue to      
                party involved. In case, if there is commitment for any result from the freelancer or tutor or candidate, and pioneer       		(picruit) is involved financially as well, and desired result is not achieved, 50 % amount will be adjusted for the given 		case with following conditions-
               Client need to present the proof of commitment from service provider side
               Client need to raise concern within 2 days of serive delivered
               Client need to deposit all dues through Picruit payment mode
               client need to present proof of score or result of services in order to clarify 
        
            
                In case of any Refunds approved by the
                pioneer academy, it will take
                3-5 days for the refund to
                be processed to the end customer.
